ML Forecasting Project Documentation
===================================

A project for fine-tuning and evaluating language models on numerical forecasting tasks using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Project Overview
---------------

This project explores the capabilities of foundation models like Qwen2.5 for numerical time-series forecasting. 
We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches and evaluate model performance on predator-prey dynamics.
