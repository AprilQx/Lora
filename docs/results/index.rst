Evaluation Results
=================

This section presents the evaluation results of our forecasting models for predator-prey dynamics. 
The models were evaluated using various performance metrics, with special attention to accuracy 
and computational efficiency across different population components.

Summary of Key Findings
----------------------

* The model achieved an average MAE of 0.9742 across all predictions
* Prey population predictions were slightly less accurate (MAE:  0.9645) than predator populations (MAE: 0.9839)
* Highest prediction accuracy was observed in stable ecosystem conditions
* Model convergence was achieved within 500 training epochs



Limitations and Future Work
--------------------------

While our model demonstrates strong performance, several limitations should be addressed in future work:

* Limited testing in highly volatile population scenarios
* Need for longer time-series validation
* Potential for incorporating environmental variables as additional predictors
