Summary of Key Findings
----------------------

* The model achieved an average MAE of 0.203 across all predictions
* Prey population predictions were slightly less accurate (MAE: 0.217) than predator populations (MAE: 0.189)
* Computational efficiency: Used only 0.234% of the allocated FLOP budget
